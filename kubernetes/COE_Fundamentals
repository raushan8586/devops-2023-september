Container Engines (CE) --> Docker, Rocket, Podman, Containerd

Container Orchestration Engine (COE) --> Kubernetes (k8s)

why?
auto-scaling
auto-loadbalancing
auto-deployment
auto-healing
auto-scheduling, auto-clustering


Kubernetes Objects:
1. Pods --> container
2. ReplicaSet --> To maintain a stable number of replica pods --> auto-healing
3. Deployment --> deploys replica of pods without downtime
4. services --> to expose the pods (front-end, back-end)
  NodePort --> to expose front-end pods (very much similar to port mapping concept in Docker)
  LoadBalancer --> to loadbalance the traffic across multiple nodes. LB uses NodePort
  ClusterIP --> front-end and back-end pods communication

Kubernetes Cloud Managed services:
AWS --> EKS
Azure --> AKS
GCP --> GKE
