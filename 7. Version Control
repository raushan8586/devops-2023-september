Version control

doc1.docx

Git --> Version control system
GitHUb --> Source Code Management / Online Code Repo --> Remote Repo

Why VCS?
1. To track changes --> who commited the changes? what was changed? when the commit was done? --> commit ID
2. To retrieve files from accidental deletes

Types of VCS
1. Centralized VCS --> svn (sub-version)
  Drawbacks:
    a. Multiple developers cann't work on the same files/project(module) at the same time
    b. To make changes, developers need to be connected to the internet all the time

2. Distributed VCS --> Git
    Local Repo

=============================================================================================
ls -la --> list the hideen files/folder --> To check whether the folder is being tracked by git or not
ls -l --> WD
git ls-files --> SA/LR 
git status --> To confirm SA or LR. untracked files --> WD, changes to committed --> SA, workign tree clean --> LR

SA (Staging Area) is a temporary Location
